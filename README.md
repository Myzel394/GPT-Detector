# GPT Detector

Determines if a text was generated by Chat GPT. It uses [GPT-2 Output Detector](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset/tree/master/detector) model to identify authenticity of the text.

## Limitations

- Reliability: The model is not fully reliable and should not be used as a sole decision making tool.
- Language Support: The model is optimized for texts written in English. Using text in other languages may give inaccurate results.
- Minimum Token Limit: While there is no minimum token limit, results tend to become more reliable when the input text contains at least 100 tokens.
- Maximum Token Limit: The current implementation of the model supports input texts with a maximum of 512 tokens. If your input text contains more than 512 tokens, the model will only process the first 512 tokens. Because of that texts longer than 512 tokens might be missclassified.

## How to run

This project contains generated files. First, you need to execute the following script in the root folder of your project.

```sh
sh scripts/build_runner.sh
```

Then, follow this [link](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset/tree/master/detector#readme) to learn how to run your own model.\
Then, create a folder named 'env' at root folder. Inside that folder create a file named '.env'.\
Lastly, paste the base url to the .env file.

```sh
BASE_URL = 'YOUR_BASE_URL'
```
